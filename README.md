# Malware-Detection-Using-ML-Algorithms

Introduction

Cybersecurity has become a major threat due to the rise in cyberthreats brought on by technological advancement. Malware and Trojans are frequent cyberattacks that seriously harm both people and businesses. Machine learning algorithms have been adopted for more efficient cyber threat identification and prevention as traditional anti-virus techniques find it difficult to keep up with increasing threats. In order to lessen the socioeconomic effects of cyberattacks, this study evaluates supervised machine learning techniques for detecting and thwarting cyber security threats.

#Problem Statement

To evaluate the performance of supervised ML algorithms in detecting various forms of cyber-attacks. The development of an effective and objective method for detecting cyber threats has the potential to mitigate cyber-attacks and reduce the socioeconomic burden it poses.

#Dataset

The data used in this study is made up of a collection of network traffic data captured from different sources at varying snapshots. The data includes both known Trojan attacks as well as attacks considered to be benign. In total, the data is made up of 79 features (both primary and derived) and consist of 15 attack classes. 


#Methodology

Network traffic data on Trojan attacks and benign instances were collected and cleaned. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied. Three techniques, undersampling, oversampling with SMOTE, and a combination of both, were used to address the highly imbalanced data.  Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed for training. Model evaluation was done using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.  The training was carried out on a local machine that runs on Central Processing Unit (CPU) with 4 cores (Intel CORE i7, 16GB RAM, 2.80GHz). The coding environment was Jupyter notebook which comes with the Anaconda package with a set of pre-installed core data science libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit learn. 

#Results

The experiment's findings demonstrated that using SMOTE to balance the dataset and PCA to reduce dimensionality together increased the performance of machine learning algorithms. When trained on the SMOTE-balanced dataset, KNN and Random Forest produced high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The approach combining SMOTE and NearMiss produces competitive results that exceed that of NearMiss alone. Depending on the technique used, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree displayed varied degrees of performance.

#Conclusion

In conclusion, this study employed various machine learning algorithms for Trojan detection and evaluated their performance using key metrics. Future work should explore additional feature engineering techniques, ensemble methods, hyperparameter optimization, and real-world deployment to assess practical applicability.
